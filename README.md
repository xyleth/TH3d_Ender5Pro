# Unified 2.0 Firmware

Unified Firmware 2.0 is the latest easy to use firmware for select 3D printers and boards from TH3D Studio. Both 8 bit and 32 bit based machines/boards are supported thanks to being built on Marlin 2.0.

This firmware focuses on printers with their stock control boards and select aftermarket boards. If you have a 3rd party or other board installed in your machine that is not supported by this firmware it is recommended to use ["Vanilla" Marlin](https://marlinfw.org) on your machine.

## Where to download and how to use it

Always download the latest firmware releases from our Unified 2 Firmware website here: [UF2.TH3DStudio.com](http://uf2.th3dstudio.com)

This GitHub repository is for tracking code changes. We have a local script that updates the download packages on the Unified 2 Firmware website linked above.

**This is ONLY tested for use with VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. Arduino IDE is not tested or supported.**

## Firmware License

Marlin and Unified 2 Firmware is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

## STL File License

Some STL files are licensed to only TH3D customers and not permitted for re-distrubution by other individuals or companies. License files are accompanied in the ZIP file/folder for STL files that have a separate license.
